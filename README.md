# BuildComAssessment

Please find my project - BuildComAsses for the test automation assessment requested. 
This is a runnable JAR file you will need to execute and the project will start immediately. 
In order to run the file you will need Java Runtime Environment 8 (or JDK 1.8) to be installed on your computer, you can download it here - 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
In addition to download and save the JAR on your computer, please download the two other drivers files(chromedriver.exe and geckodriver.exe) and save them in the same path as the jar. 

The system should run test flows on Chrome and FireFox browsers simultaneously and would submit and open a report file for each driver at the end of the process.
The system works best with Chrome v. 61 and FireFox v. 55. however the Chrome version was not tested enough since the CAPTCHA interfere in the process and made it difficult. CAPTCHA page should be disabled on the server when creating an automated test system.
