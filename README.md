The system should run test flows on Chrome and FireFox browsers simultaneously and would submit and open a report file for each driver at the end of the process.
The system works best with Chrome v. 61 and FireFox v. 55. however the Chrome version was not tested enough since the CAPTCHA interfere in the process and made it difficult. CAPTCHA page should be disabled on the server when creating an automated test system.
